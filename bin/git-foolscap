LONGHELP = '''\
Use this tool to publish a git repository via a Foolscap application server
(aka "flappserver"). Once configured, this creates an access string known as
a "FURL". You can then use this FURL as a git URL on any client which has the
"git-remote-pb" helper installed.

You can also use "invite" and "accept" to deliver the FURL via a secure
protocol named "Magic-Wormhole". This prints a short string which you can read
to the recipient. This requires the sender to leave "git-foolscap invite"
running until the recipient has executed "git-foolscap accept".

These FURLs provide cryptographically-secure access to a specific resource.
Unlike SSH keys, the holder of this FURL is limited to a single command (e.g.
git receive-pack). This is safer and easier to configure than putting
command/environment restrictions on an SSH key, and does not require running
a daemon as root.

To publish a git repo, first prepare the server. You must pick a TCP port to
listen on, and you need to know the hostname by which clients can reach your
computer.

 git foolscap init --port tcp:3116 --location tcp:example.com:3116

This creates a daemon that listens for inbound Foolscap connections. The daemon
must be running and reachable by your clients. A working directory for the
daemon is created in .git/foolscap . You must start the daemon before clients
can use it:

 git foolscap start

You probably want to arrange for the daemon to be started at system reboot as
well. On OS-X systems, use LaunchAgent. On unix systems (with Vixie cron),
the simplest technique is to add a "@reboot" crontab entry that looks like
this:

 @reboot cd PATH/TO/REPO && git foolscap start

Now use the "add" command to grant read-write access to the repository.

 git foolscap add read-write "for Bob"

That command will emit a FURL. The comment, which follows the mode, is
mandatory, and is recorded locally to help you remember who you gave the FURL
to. You can grant read-only access too, by using `read-only` instead of
`read-write`.

Give this FURL to somebody via a secure channel. Remind them to install
Foolscap and the "git-remote-pb" program (`pipx install git-foolscap`).
If they're creating a clone of your repository, they'll run:

 git clone FURL

If instead, they are adding a new Git "remote" to an existing repository,
they'll need to choose a name for the remote. Then they should run:

 git remote add NAME FURL

As an alternative to copying the whole FURL, you can use the invitation
mechanism. On the server side, use the "invite" command:

 git foolscap invite read-write "for Dave"

This produces a "wormhole code" instead of a FURL (the FURL is delivered
through the wormhole). Dave can then clone the repo by typing this code into:

 git foolscap accept clone

Or Dave can add the FURL to an existing repo with:

 git foolscap accept add-remote

Each FURL will either be limited to read-only operations, or it will allow both
read and write (i.e. clients can push into this repo). You must choose one or
the other when you create the FURL. Note that you can easily create multiple
FURLs for the same repo, some read-only, others read-write.

 git foolscap add read-only for-Alice
 git foolscap add read-write "for Bob"

You can revoke any FURL, to shut off access by whoever you gave that FURL to.
It is useful to create a new FURL for each client, so you can revoke them
separately. The "list" command will display an integer index for each FURL, and
you'll use that index to revoke them.

 git foolscap list
 git foolscap revoke 2

Prepare a Git repository for access by Foolscap FURLs.

By default, this creates a foolscap "flappserver" inside the .git directory (at
.git/foolscap). This can be created elsewhere by using e.g.
--flappserver=~/.flappserver , which may be useful if you want to share the
server between multiple repositories. In this case, a symlink from
.git/foolscap to the --flappserver directory will be created. If the target
server already exists, it will not be modified, but the symlink will still be
created.

If the server is being created, it must be given a --port and --location. The
port is where the server listens: "tcp:3116" is the default. Location is how
clients are instructed to reach it, which typically consists of
type/hostname/port, like "tcp:example.com:3116". If the server already exists,
these arguments are ignored.

'''
You can create as many FURLs as you want. Each one can be revoked separately.
To revoke a FURL, use "flappserver list" to find the one you want, get its
"swissnum", delete the corresponding directory under
~/.flappserver/services/SWISSNUM , then use "flappserver restart
~/.flappserver" to restart the server.
